### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Using web responsive images can be tricky especially because I wasn't using the mobile-first workflow. I had to lookup:

- how to fit content inside a div where adjusting height: 100%; property of the div came in handy.
- how to play around with the viewport height and adjust content accordingly using e.g. max-height: 95%;
- how to deal with overflow
- how to add a color filter to an immage. I basically used z-index and opacity to get around that but I'll have to do more semantic css research.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue learning and adapting to how to use responsive images and how to adjust them with custom css.
